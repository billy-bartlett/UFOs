# UFOs

## Overview
For this project, I was tasked with taking a dataset of UFO Sightings and coding it to load into an online html article webpage. This webpage allows users to filter the UFO Sighting data using multiple criteria at the same time: date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
Users can filter their search on the left side of the webpage. They can enter a date in addition to a city, state, country, and shape using the search fields displayed in the image below.

## Summary
One drawback of the current webpage design is that users cannot filter using a date range. Rather, users are only allowed to search using one specific date at a time.

Two potential improvements to the website include aligning the table of data to the above article and an overhaul of the article layout. Aligning the table of data would improve the aesthetics of the webpage and create more cohesiveness throughout the page. For the article section, moving the title above the article would be more aesthetically pleasing, rather than placing it to the left. With this change, an additional image could be added to the vacant left space to add more visuals, perhaps a picture of Dr. Ursula F. Olivier, who is quoted in the article, or a picture of the World UFO Day event.
